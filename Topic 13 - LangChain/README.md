# Topic 13 - LangChain

## What this repository do?

This is an experimental repository for LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. I will somehow explore several functionalities of this framework, then extract which kind of applications that I can build using this framework.

As the first step, I have followed the Quickstart in the [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/getting_started.html), and perform a specific usecase using LangChain, exploratory data analysis.

In the second stage, I will go through mostly all of the [tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/getting_started/tutorials.html) given in the documentation to earn a better insight about this framework. Notes are recorded in this README file.
