# NLP Pretrained Models with HuggingFaces

## What this repository do?

Tutorial on fine-tuning pretrained models (in this tut, BERT) using HuggingFaces.

## How to run this repository?

Just need to install necessary packages (`torch`, `tensorflow`, `transformers`, `datasets`) and run the `.ipynb` notebooks.

## Struggle and Derived Tips during implementation

Since the implementation is quite straight-forward, it is rare to see anything barrier that took me a huge amount of time. The thing that I would spend time is to see any new-looking functions to me.
