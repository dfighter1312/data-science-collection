# My Data Science Collection

**Owner:** Hoang-Dung Nguyen (Nguyễn Hoàng Dũng). Fresh Graduate from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, from Computer Science, but are in love with Data Science.

Hope that the set of projects will inspire you guys who are also having passion with Data Science. I know this is a vast field, and I am sometimes dizzy as well when learning this and knowing that something I have learned would not benefit me in getting a job (I am still somehow unemployed, so please give me a job to embrace myself), but I believe the journey to become a Data Scientist will grow gradually in me.

## Structure of the repository

The repository is divided into topics, and each topic's material is contained within a folder. There are 4 aspects covered across the topics, and I will index it in this `README.md` file.

Since it is a set of mini-projects, there is no or just a little overlap between projects. However, it should be a must to combine ideas I have learned in these projects to make a capstone project (which I believe should have been conducted after every 20 mini-projects).
