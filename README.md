# My Data Science Collection

Owner: Hoang-Dung Nguyen (Nguyễn Hoàng Dũng). Fresh Graduate from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, from Computer Science, but are in love with Data Science.

Hope that the set of projects will inspire you guys who are also having passion with Data Science. I know this is a vast field, and I am sometimes dizzy as well when learning this and knowing that something I have learned would not benefit me in getting a job (I am still somehow unemployed, so please give me a job to embrace myself), but I believe the journey to become a Data Scientist will grow gradually for me.

## Structure of the repository

The repository is divided into topic, and each topic's material in within a folder. There are 3 aspects covered across the topics, and I will index it in this `README.md` file.
