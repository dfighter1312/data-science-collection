# Electric Moped Reviews

## What this repository do?

Give an exploratory data analysis on electric moped reviews. This was a practical exam for the Data Science Associate Certificate by DataCamp, and I am grad to share my notebook although there may exist some dummy thoughts within it.

The exam contains 10 tasks which I stated them clearly in the attached notebook, and I include the data in this folder as well.

## Struggle and Derived Tips during implementation

**1. Trimodal distribution**

This might be the first time I have heard about trimodal distribution, which is a distribution with 3 peaks. There is also a bimodal distribution with 2 peaks as well.

Quick challenge: List out as many distributions as I can think of:
- Bernouli distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Exponential distribution
- Uniform distribution
- Normal/Gaussian distribution
- alpha distribution
- beta distribution
- Bimodal & Trimodal distribution

Hmm I think that is all I know.
