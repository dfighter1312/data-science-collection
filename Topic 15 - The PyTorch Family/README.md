# Topic 15 - The PyTorch Family (PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, PyTorch Lightning)

## What this repository do?

This is the topic where I summarize all the beginner to intermediate-level knowledge on PyTorch, with several extension of graph implementation in PyTorch Geometric, and a quick view on PyTorch lightning. Here are several research questions for this topic:

1. What are all general concepts in PyTorch that we should know?
2. How is implementing things in PyTorch 1.x different from PyTorch 2.x?
3. What functionalities do PyTorch Geometric provide?
4. What trade-off is considered when using PyTorch lightning? Is this a proper framework for research or production?
5. Is there any PyTorch-related framework in the industry right now?

Those questions will be answered after learning is done in the *Struggle and Derived Tips during implementation* part.
