# Generative Adversarial Networks

## What this repository do?

Hands-on implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) in both Pytorch and Tensorflow as frameworks. Links of the tutorials are on the official pages from each framework (can check it at the References part).

## How to run this repository?

**Step 1:** Go to the directory
```bash
cd "Topic 9 - Generative Adversarial Networks"
```

**Step 2:** Install `torch` or `tensorflow`. Search on Google for more details

**Step 3:** Run the test by the following script
```bash
python test_pt.py
```

For PyTorch, or:

```bash
python test_tf.py
```

## Struggle and Derived Tips during implementation

Since the implementation is quite straight-forward, it is rare to see anything barrier that took me a huge amount of time. The thing that I would spend time is to see any new-looking functions to me.

One notice is that Tensorflow may take less lines of code for training and checking the results than PyTorch.
